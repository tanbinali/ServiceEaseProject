## Usage

* Register and login users via `/auth/` endpoints (powered by Djoser).
* Admin users can create and manage services, categories, orders, and users.

* Use nested endpoints to manage related data (e.g., services under categories, reviews under services).

---

## Permissions

* **Client:** Restricted access, primarily to their own data and public information.
* **Anonymous:** Read-only access to categories, services, and public reviews.
